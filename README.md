# PVoutput_requests
Request and parse pv power generation. Implementation in python/pandas and Jupyter
<br>
<br>
Implementation of the get status API available from pvoutput: https://pvoutput.org/help.html#api-getstatus.  
Specific use case was to get (hourly) solar production data from any available system - so not necessarily self-owned.


<br>
<br>
Note that this requires an API private key that is only provided through pvoutput's donation (star) program (15 AUD for a year as of writing)
